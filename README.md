# DeepDOA
An implementation of a Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE)-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) for direction finding (DF) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is motivated by the practical challenges associated with classical DF algorithms such as MUSIC and ESPRIT. 

The proposed DF scheme is practical and low-complex in the sense that a phase synchronization mechanism, an antenna calibration mechanism, and the analytical model of the antenna radiation pattern are not essential. Also, the proposed DF method can be implemented using a single-channel RF receiver.

### Dependencies

- Tensorflow (recommended below 1.5)
- Numpy 1.14.4

### Dataset

A partial dataset is provided to demonstrate our method
training data : Dround_Data_New/Normalized
testing data : Dround_Data_New/Normalized_test

data are categorized according to 45 degree sectors in training/testing data 
eg : 'deg_0_normalize.csv' data file represent the training data collected from the first sector and like wise there are 8 sectors considered for this study

For more details, please see our paper below.
